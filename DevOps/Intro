1. What is DevOps?
--> DevOps is a culture that improves the ability to deliver the Software or Applications by ensuring that the
Automation is in place, the quality of the code is as per standard, the continuous monitoring and continuous testing is properly setup.

2. Why DevOps?
--> Earlier the software delivery process was a very distributed process and it was manual where there were different
people for building, testing and deploying applications. This process was long and lengthy. The software delivery
would take so much of time to deliver the software. It was getting difficult to co-ordinate for all these people to 
deliver your application because everything was manual process.
--> That's when DevOps came into place. Through DevOps tools only one person called "DevOps Engineer" can do all
these things by himself. He can build the application, test the application, create infrastructure and then deliver
the application all by himself.

3. What is Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC)?
--> It is a standard or process in the Software industry to design, develop and test the applications.
--> The end goal is to deliver a high quality product.
